## Answer:
- Graceful degradation focuses on ensuring that web applications provide an optimal experience on modern browsers and devices. However, they only remain functional in older or less capable environments. On the other hand, service workers are standalone scripts operating independently of the main web app by managing tasks like caching and network requests without blocking the main thread. This capability allows web applications to maintain core functionality even when some advanced features are unsupported or fail, such as internet or network access.
